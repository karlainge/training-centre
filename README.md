# Project Scenario

## Introduction

**Computer Training Centre** website is based on [proposal](https://github.com/Anjela-Mikhaylova/assignment2/blob/master/documentation/Class%20Register%20System.pdf) of 
software system I am create for Team Development Project, where I am designing Windows Forms application 
for [Class Register System](https://github.com/Anjela-Mikhaylova/assignment2/blob/master/documentation/Class%20Register%20System.pdf) (IMAT3903).  For Front-End Web Development module, I am to create only user interface, but not back-end. 

At all the designing stages process I have been following [scenario](https://github.com/Anjela-Mikhaylova/assignment2/blob/master/documentation/Scenario%20-%20Computer%20Training%20Centre.pdf) 
of the project and would like to outline that the website has been created according to _Establishing purpose_ part.

### **1. Establishing purpose**

A small training organisation that provides computer training to the unemployed requires a website that 
would simplify the user interaction and will be effective, efficient and satisfy specified users 
_“to extent to which an end-user is able to carry out required tasks successfully”_ (Ravden and Johnson, 1989).

### **2. Creating a design strategy**

At the very initial stage of designing process I have established what to include to webpages.  
I have created [Computer Training Centre Information Architecture plan,](https://github.com/Anjela-Mikhaylova/assignment2/blob/master/documentation/Scenario%20-%20Computer%20Training%20Centre.pdf) 
where I have included information on:
* Website Specification,
* Subset of Functionalities, 
* Target audience, 
* Personas.  

As well as that, I have included _Colour scheme_ I am going to use, _fonts,_ and _look and feel_ of the website.

### **3. Mock-up sketches**

Second stage included creating [Mock-up sketches](https://github.com/Anjela-Mikhaylova/assignment2/blob/master/documentation/Mock-up%20sketches.pdf) according to Information Architecture plan, 
where I have designed following five pages: Home page, Courses page, Schedule page, Tutor page, and Find us page.  

All raw sketches I have included to the Documentation folder. The [Mock-up sketches.pdf file](https://github.com/Anjela-Mikhaylova/assignment2/blob/master/documentation/Mock-up%20sketches.pdf) 
is the summarised version, where all the sketches included.

### **4. Wireframes**

Next stage was creating a very simple prototype of webpages, showing the basic layout, information and elements 
that need to be on each page of the site.  [Wireframes](https://anjela-mikhaylova.github.io/assignment2/wireframe/homepage.htmlhttps://www.w3schools.com/css/css_link.asp) 
included areas for logo, primary navigation, headings, and content indicating the important parts of every page.

### **5. Building website**

I have started building website in November and tried to be close to scenario, i.e. look and feel of the website 
should be very simple, so novice users could easily locate needed information. 

I have identified my target audience in order to ensure the design and content will appeal to them, i.e:

* How old are my users? _(Middle age)_
* How much or how often do they user the web?
* What other sites could they visit?
* What would be their purpose to visit my website? _(To find and enrol to computing courses)_
* What kind of jobs they had before unemployment? _(Their job did not include using computers, therefore they will try 
to find computing courses to change qualifiction)_

This website was built for users who are not competent in browsing information in Internet, 
as well as frequent and competent web users.  The main requirements are simplicity and efficiency in use.

### **6. Usability Testing**

The purpose of [Usability Requirements](https://github.com/Anjela-Mikhaylova/assignment2/blob/master/documentation/Usability%20Testing.pdf) 
of the **Computer Training Centre** website is to produce a set of specific testable usability specifications for proposed website.

I have carried out user testing to identify problems that may arise while using **Computer Training Centre** website in real life.  
Some issues that my user tester outlined helped me to identify the problem and eliminate it. Please, see the 
next part _How I was solving problems_ where I am discussing the issue as well as [Usability Testing](https://github.com/Anjela-Mikhaylova/assignment2/blob/master/documentation/Usability%20Testing.pdf), 
where user testing process was documented.

### **7. How I was solving problems**

* **GitHub.**  This was the biggest problem, since I was constantly getting error messages on command prompt.  
I could not clone labs and push back the work I have done. Me and my tutor (Mrs Fania Raczinski) tried to upload 
website I have been designing, but we could not solve the problem.  

Mrs Raczinski uploaded a video explaining in detail on how to use GitHub that helped me to solve all my issues.  
I started bringing my laptop to lab sessions and since that had no more problems.  

* Working on usability requrements during building process, included [Usability Testing,](https://github.com/Anjela-Mikhaylova/assignment2/blob/master/documentation/Usability%20Testing.pdf)
where I have realised that changes to be made to Scedule page’s layout in order to make this page easier and convenient to use. 
I have rebuilt this page using lab 5 (The three languages of the web DEMO).


### **8. HTML and CSS validation**

I have redularly been validating [HTML](https://github.com/Anjela-Mikhaylova/assignment2/blob/master/documentation/HTML%20%20and%20CSS%20validation.pdf) 
and [CSS](https://github.com/Anjela-Mikhaylova/assignment2/blob/master/documentation/HTML%20%20and%20CSS%20validation.pdf) pages.  Only one page (sitemap.html)
has one error related to nested lists. I have used the [Nested List](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_lists_nested) from W3schools website, 
therefore I do not think this is an error and I decided not to change anything in my sitemap.html page.
